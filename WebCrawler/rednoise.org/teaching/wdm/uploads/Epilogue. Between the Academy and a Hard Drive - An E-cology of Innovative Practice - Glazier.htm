<P>Innovative print poetries have been defined in numerous instances
in terms of their investigation of varying forms of textual
materiality. Indeed one way to differentiate an innovative writing
from one that is confessional, conservative, or that has not gotten
beyond the tropes of modernism, is to look at how meaning functions in
the work. Does the poem -- or the prose -- treat language as a
transparent bearer of meaning? By contrast, an innovative work can be
said to treat the making of meaning as problematic. Further, this
criterion of meaning as problematic cannot be fulfilled by simply
inserting vagueness into the text's narrative or by simply serializing
elements, but is realized through an investigation of the material
elements of writing in the given medium. In other words, from the
viewpoint of innovative practice, "literature" is not a heavenly
liquid drunk from a clear crystal goblet. It is the struggle with the
goblet that presents the problem: its smoothness, its temperature, the
way the concept of the liquid is changed by being in that goblet, the
social group with which it is associated, the dysraphism present at
the point the liquid makes contact with the surface of the glass, and
other similar facts, that innovative practice pursues.</P>
<P>&#9;If this struggle between transparency and materiality is at
issue in print poetry, then it is of even greater importance in
electronic literature. This is especially true where the
code/interface relation is concerned, effectively constituting three
theatres in which the struggle with transparency can occur: code,
interface, and text. How does one investigate these three scenes of
activity? How does one describe their dynamics? How does one learn the
contours of the digital text, its quirks, its marvelous interweaving
of strands of code, surface language, the conditions in which it
exists? How does one educate about temporality, discontinuity, error
messages, material that is there one minute and is not the next, the
"not found". Is it time to enroll in Digital Poetry 404? Can the
e-text indeed even be said to be material? Clearly, the argument here
is that it <U>is</U> material. To substantiate this assertion, a
consideration of the criteria for such a materiality will be be
considered in this Epilogue, as will traps in misreading the
innovative in digital media.</P>
<P>&#9;Such a focus on the materials of digital literature seems
particularly germane with the recent establishment of the Electronic
Literature Organization (ELO) in October, 1999. This is an
organization that seeks to "highlight the creative efforts of authors
who are producing new forms of literary content based in electronic
media", in the words of the flyer announcing the found of the
Electronic Literature Organization. This is an important goal and such
an organization could be a valuable agency in the growth of this
literature, a literature, it might be noted, that is not as much "new"
but present and active. We look forward to the possibility that this
organization will accomplish the goals it has set before itself. More
works will, of course, be forthcoming. As we look towards
orchestrating the electric light that comprises this medium, what is
crucial is to focus on what constitutes electronic literature. That
is, one must eschew work that simply reinscribes literary practice
bound within the shackles of modernism and other pre-digital textual
modes, and look to works that are advancing the medium. We should look
for works that are creating new paradigms for narrative and poetic
practice based on the textuality of the electronic medium. To explain
this, we can consider textuality to be like a pre-Conquest
America. Rather than leveling the landscape and pretending it is
merely an inert surface upon which to found an empire, let us plant
our works within the context of what the medium brings to the scene of
art-making, its materiality.</P>
<P>In reference to the investigation I propose, one that seeks an
affirmation of the <U>facts</U> of the material struggle, I am
reminded of the very Mexican exclamation, "&#161;orale!"
"&#161;Orale!" means, "Speak it!" or "Indeed!" but with emphasis to
the point of, "Tell it like it is!" The essence of the expression is
in orating, or giving a correct oral message (that's the "oral" in
"orale"). "&#161;Orale!" speaks to the engagement with the real of the
activity or fact that is being asserted. What I think is essential at
this point in electronic literature is to focus our attention on works
that engage the "real" of the activity, continuing innovative practice
in poetry and fiction. That is, practice that has provided a critique
of cultural status quo and of our ways of reading as an apparatus of
that status quo. Innovative practice has pioneered not only new media
but new ways of perceiving through a given medium, a practice that has
localized art not as a way of <U>representing</U> but as a way of
<U>making</U>. As William Carlos Williams writes:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When a [poet] ... makes a poem, makes it, mind you, he takes words
as he finds them interrelated about him and composes them -- without
distortion which would mar their exact significances -- into an
intense expression of his perceptions and ardors that they may
constitute a revelation in the speech that he uses. It isn't what he
<U>says</U> that counts as a work of art, it's what he makes.... What
does it matter what the line "says"? (Collected 54)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Such a sense of making is what makes <U>writing</U>
tick. &#161;Orale!.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">What Makes It Innovative?</P>
<P>One must acknowledge the innovations that have lead us to this
point, the extraordinary work of Jorge Luis Borges, Julio Cortazar,
James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, William Carlos Williams, and Louis
Zukofsky, codex writers who created hypertexts that pre-dated the
microchip. More recently, one must acknowledge all of the artists of
"first wave hypertext" (print) and "second wave hypertext" (graphical)
periods described by N. Katherine Hayles. These waves do, indeed,
break into enticing surf. Yet, though valuable ground has been
covered, I'm not sure we have yet framed literary digital practice in
a way that would allow us to see the paperless forest for the digital
trees. Have there been works in recent decades that surpass the codex
precursors mentioned above? Or are our reading habits causing us to
look at texts that are less than revolutionary? When it comes to
locating the great literary works of the digital age, if they exist,
it may well prove that in the present era one would find that the
academic lens is focussed too narrowly to pinpoint the forest in front
of which we stand.</P>
<P>The problem with the question, "Where can we find hypertexts
appropriate for literary analysis," lies within the question
itself. The same confusion exists in the fact that for many faculty
with whom I work, despite the fact that my graduate seminar is titled
"New Media Poetries" and my book is called <U>Digital Poetics</U>, I
am known as "the hypertext guy". In other words one must stop
associating innovative digital practice solely with
hypertext. Link-node hypertext only constitutes a small part of the
range of possibilities before us and may, indeed, be a specific
ideology within print technology, as Aarseth has commented, rather
than an actual digital technology. In this sense, hypertext merely
remediates print in the electronic medium and does not, by this fact
alone, engage the new technology. For that reason, we should stop
assuming that if a work is in hypertext, it is by definition,
digitally innovative. That is like saying, if I stood before you
dressed in a pilot's suit, that I would be a pilot and not a poet. No,
I would just be a poet in a pilot's suit, a fact that would have
horrifying potential if I happened to be in the cockpit on your next
flight -- though I could guarantee that the intercom announcements
would be frequent and entertaining.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">What Criteria Do We Use?</P>
<P>&#9;How then do we begin to construct a frame that would define
innovative practice in digital literature? Let me suggest the
following criteria, not as a definitive list but as a first draft of a
list-in-progress.</P>
<P>1. The position of the "I". Innovative work avoids the
personalized, ego-centered position of the romantic, realist, or
modernist "I". We should consider such a sentimentalized "I", often
concerned with its own mortality, as having passed away. Innovative
practice is practice that often overcomes the "I" to explore material
dimensions of the text. This is, as Robin Blaser has written:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>that matter of language caught</P>
<P>in the fact   so that we</P>
<P>meet in paradise   in such</P>
<P>times, the I consumes itself</P>
<P>(Holy 61)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Indeed, the "I" exists in digital literature but not as an
omniscient narrator. Rather, it is an initiator of a process that,
once begun, "takes over", thereby consuming the "I".</P>
<P>2. The material. Text grows from code, draws from the drama of
code, is rooted in the material of C, or HTML, or Java. We need to
find the convergences and irritations that occur on the boundaries of
code and text. That is, it is not interactive fiction but interactive
friction that warms the text. To make the work directly related to its
semantic-material context is a smart way to work. Smart, the way
Atlanta subway system's URL, </FONT><A
HREF="http://www.itsmarta.com/"><FONT FACE="Verdana"
SIZE=2>www.itsmarta.com</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>, can be
read both as "www it is marta dot com" but equally, given a regional
pronunciation, "www it's smarter dot com". Or, in a more general
sense, using landscape architecture as a metaphor, the new critical
approach is to wipe out everything that existed at the building site
and start with razed ground. The structure is built, then trees are
later planted where others were torn out to give some natural look to
the lot. In this approach there is little consideration given the
contours of the land, its ecology, its material, or to what spaces are
being covered and uncovered, as Peter Bishop has pointed out in <U>The
Greening of Psychology</U>. (We need only consider the undersides of
bridges to find the most desolate landscapes in the modern world.) An
approach that embodies the best of the innovative is to understand the
world that is there and to integrate the building within the natural
contours and features of the landscape. This not merely a logical way
to proceed but one that is eco-logical, in the best sense of both
words. As John Cage noted in "Aspects of a New Consciousness", art is
about becoming open to our environment. Accordingly, the innovative
digital literary text employs an architecture that places textual
structures within the contours and values unique to its medium, a
practice of textual e-cology.</P>
<P>3. Enabling of new tools of intelligence. This quality points to an
avoidance of the reinscription of authority, totalizing positions, and
commodification of the artistic work. It suggests that writing should
be seen, not as a personalized achievement, but as a series of strands
in a larger social-spatial textual fabric (the network). It points to
a sometimes jazz-like cacophony that sets the stage for the outburst
of material properties to illuminate the site of the text. The honks,
the squawks, the squeals that let you know the jazz instrument is
brass, or wood, or reed. Further, as we explore ways to work in the
medium, be they morphing programs or animation formats or algorithmic
patterns; these tools are not viewed as ways to simply realize a
personal project. Rather, as completely different tools in the
artist's repertoire, they expand the metaphoric scope of the human
imagination. For a modest example, the "alt" tag to the "image" of
innovative jazz raised above would read, alt="Ornette Coleman, not
Kenny G". As to the importance of programming to new modes of
intelligence, it is no coincidence that the first program that just
about every programmer writes is called "hello, world", a program that
outputs nothing more than the simple statement on the screen, "Hello,
world". This can be seen to indicate a new way of approaching the
world, realized through the algorithm.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">What Are Some Traps? </P>
<P>1. The narrative. The problem is not narrative itself but, as has
been mentioned, the fetishization of narrative, or as Markku Eskelinen
has described it, "pompous attempts to master the text". The narrative
must not be intentional or manipulative. It must also be able to be
random, spontaneous, and outside of traditional plot structures. The
idea of plot can give way to a confluence of possibilities for the
word to make meaning. Simulation, as Espen Aarseth has commented, is
one of these future possibilities. There are many as yet untouched
ways to explore character, identity, and action. What about the
circulation of "cheat codes" which, when put into a video game can,
for example, make your tight end able to run 100 miles an hour or make
every player in the football game able to leap twenty feet high? In
this light, I always wonder what the video game makers would think
about my son. When he got a new football video game, he played it
incessantly. His interest in the video game culminated with his
learning to customize two teams, his and the machine's. He, a boy from
Buffalo, then created a super team of Bills and a pathetic team of the
Cowboys and now plays Superbowl games where the Bills incredibly score
350 points. But that's not the whole point -- the challenge for him
is, on top of that huge score, to make it a shutout! In another game,
NBA Live 99, he created a custom character named Charles Bernstein,
endowed with high skill levels. Bernstein played a few games,
performing brilliant one-handed 360 jams. But there was an even
greater challenge in store. The next custom character to be created
was Loss Glazier, just in time for a three-point face off with
Bernstein. The results of that match will, for diplomacy's sake,
remain undisclosed. I'm not sure that these examples are what the game
makers had in mind but I think they show that alternate narratives do
exist.</P>
<P>2. The link. It is time to stop thinking of the link as being, by
nature, innovative. (John Cayley has referred to links as "nilsk" an
anagrammic rearrangement that emphasizes their "null" value.) Further,
the word should be circulated that link-node hypertext is not the only
form of hypertext. It is simply the most common. And yet, its biggest
shortcoming is its closeness to print. As Cayley notes, "A node-link
hypertext can become a book and vice versa, but text generators
require programmatons" (Programmatology n.p.). Programmatons, in
Cayley's parlance, are computers. Thus he is insisting that the
node-link hypertext and the book can be interchanged but the frontier
of the innovative, the non-link digital text, <U>requires</U> the
medium to support it. This is one way to evaluate the relevance of
innovative practice in digital media.</P>
<P>3. The author vs. programmer. The idea of the author must be
considered in relation to the concept of the programmer. The
connotations that "author" brings to the text, power, authority,
mastery of the text-producing fields, are often less than helpful for
innovative writing. Yet the idea of the programmer, on the other hand,
or poet-programmer might offer a potentially interesting
alternative. The concept of a poet-programmer or prose-programmer is
of a person who works among the tangles of the vines that yield the
work. It is of one who sets up a series of events that culminates in
the work as an action or execution of procedures. It includes a
concept of intelligence that is more concerned with setting into
motion a number of variables than trying to freeze, can, or embalm the
outcome. The concern is, more specifically, with the parameters,
character, and nuances of that motion, not with any one of its
possible productions.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Where Do We Want To Go? </P>
<P>1. The field has to be reconstituted. In a similar manner to the
way that Charles Olson re-mapped the concept of the field when it came
to the relationship between typographic spacing and the codex page, we
must admit code, the visual, and the transient to our concept of the
field of the innovative digital work. As N. Katherine Hayles pointed
out in "Print is Flat, Code is Deep", writing can no longer
exclusively be considered the projection of ideas from the flat,
uniform plane of print. (To such a distinction I would also add the
"underworld" of the actual mark-up or programming language
itself. There is a plethora of new fields to be furrowed!) The text
now revels in radical forms of adjacency; a metonymy that comes from
overlaying, collage, juxtaposition of visual elements, and forms of
mapping. These are forms, I might add, that innovative print poetry
has investigated extensively and from which many lessons can be
drawn. Digital innovative practice can add to this the action programs
realize and the concept of programming as writing.</P>
<P>2. The commune/web. To consider where our world stands in relation
to a concept of open and shared textuality, we only need to consider a
newspaper headline like the following: "Global Competition Fells Japan
Tradition" (USA Today, 1/27/99, page 1). It shows that to be "gone
global" is to take the paradigm of U.S. economic competition and, when
the scale changes, simply transfer it to the new scale. What is
ignored are the implications of "global". Take for example its
ecological implications. It is not necessarily productive in the long
run to fell things, traditions or forests, to maximize profits. Or
again, an enlightened concept of "global" would include the fact that
we collectively share a place, an environment, a network. In textual
terms, it means that writing is a whole and that as individuals we are
just a part of that whole. How much more interesting the "text" of a
literary conference, for example, becomes when we consider the whole
conference a text, rather than looking to an individual presentation
for that sort of breadth!</P>
<P>3. The non-semantic, the spatial, and the polymedial open new
registers in possibility for the text. It is crucial to recognize that
emergent forms of expression may not necessarily be recognizable as
variants of previous forms. In addition, forms that are "live", that
execute in the presence of the reader, offer experiences in textuality
a world apart from the rigidity of fixed paths through a textual
field. Such concepts help locate new media within the innovative
tradition.</P>

<P>Given such a topology of electronic materiality, we are then
obliged to examine existing electronic literature to see where it
would fit into such a scheme. Indeed, is all electronic literature
innovative? Which electronic works push innovative writing practices
and which rely on more modernist or new critical understandings of the
"word"? Is materiality the way to make this distinction? What other
attributes constitute the innovative in an e-poetry, hypertext, or
other digital work of art? What valence does the visual bear? How do
you classify the role of procedure in relation to a text that is
produced?</P>
<P>We have clearly entered a new era; now we, as literary and cultural
scholars, must take the next step. The question is whether we take
advantage of this transition to recognize work that advances the
possibilities of our culture or whether we only pursue accessible
discourse and familiar models, simply reinscribing old values onto new
media. We must wrest ourselves away from our moorings so that we allow
our bearings to adjust to the medium at hand; we do not want to echo
the genre-lapse of the movie review who describes a film as "a
voluptuous page-turner of a movie". It is as if we have been given a
huge, brand new, conceptually revolutionary operating system. The
question then becomes, do we simply Laplink our old files to the new
machine, or do we use this opportunity to reinvigorate and fortify our
intelligence? What places us in that uncomfortable position between
the Academy and a hard drive, is the fact that we must make a
difficult choice. Can we defy our habits? Our idea of the digital
literary work is confined by literary practice that has become
habitual by nature; thus it is hard to see something anew and part
with old habits. The hard choice before is to identify new forms of
literature, not to look to old forms in new clothes.</P>
<P>I find the present <U>social condition of the disposable
environment</U> to show a troubling lack of focus on the material (the
planet, our relations with others, our shared intelligence). Art has
historically addressed such issues and it is no different now. What is
culturally necessary is to broaden ways of seeing. Digital
technologies give us alternative and multiple ways to "make" the
world. Engaging the materiality of the digital medium is a way to
genuinely engage writing and is the path that must be pursued. As
culture progresses through innovation, it is the innovative in digital
literature that can open more doors to our relation to the text and to
the world. </P>
<P>Literary culture in general is still not far from the computer
phobia that existed in the early days of word processing. As digital
media scholars, we must push our views about what we demand from
digital art as far as we can, to pull literary culture along a little
more. The digital condition is real and present; it is quite urgent
that we address the live and vibrant fact of the digital literature
before us. What do we need to do? We need to get under the hood of
this silicon horse, roll it through the gates of academia, and, if I
might refer to the fact that the first digital culture conference
occurred in Bergen, Norway, pour out with brandished fjords. We need
to discover adequate terms and an appropriate discourse to describe
the unfathomed richness of the materials of the digital medium. We
need to really get into digital textuality. We should demand more from
our monitors and see beyond computerized works that could simply exist
on paper, the way Amiri Baraka saw the limits of the typewriter of his
generation:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>A typewriter?--why shd it only make use of the tips of the fingers
as contact points of flowing multi directional creativity. If I
invented a word placing machine, an "expression-scriber," if you will,
then I would have a kind of instrument into which I could step &amp;
sit or sprawl or hang &amp; use not only my fingers to make words
express feelings but elbows, feet, head, behind, and all the sounds I
wanted, screams, grunts, taps, itches, I'd have magnetically recorded,
at the same time, &amp; translated into word -- or perhaps even the
final xpressed thought/feeling wd not be merely word or sheet, but
itself, the xpression, three dimensional -- able to be touched, or
tasted or felt, or entered, or heard or carried like a speaking
singing constantly communicating charm. A typewriter is corny!!
(Technology 156)</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Electronic media is physical; it is material. It is valuable to
explore its possibilities through innovative practice. Echoing the
passage above we might say that word-processed poems or less than
revelatory link-node exercises would be, by Baraka's terms, also
"corny". Offering not a real engagement with digital practice but,
borrowing also from Lawrence Ferlinghetti, a "corny island of the
mind". Let us take Baraka's suggestion to heart. Get into the guts of
<U>making</U> in this medium. Emerge from the study with wires tangled
in your hair, pixels in your spirit, happy to have found that physical
interaction with the intangible that makes it
<U>making</U>. &#161;Orale!</P>
