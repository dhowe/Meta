                  literature, defined as the production of
                  continuously changing literary texts by means of a
                  specific dictionary, some set of rules and the use
                  of algorithms, is a very specific form of digital
                  literature which is completely changing most of the
                  concepts of classical literature. Texts being
                  produced by a computer and not written by an
                  author, require indeed a very special way of
                  engrammation and, in consequence, also point to a
                  specific way of reading particularly concerning all
                  the aspects of the literary time. In my paper, I
                  will try to present some of the characteristics of
                  generative texts and their consequences for the
                  conception of literature itself.<BR>
                  I call "engrammation" the adaptation of expression
                  wills to the technical constraints of the medium
                  used for its mediatisation. For instance, a book
                  needs a fixed writing, and the mediatisation by
                  means of a screen needs other modalities of
                  presentation.</FONT></div>

         literature&#8221; a literature where the texts are produced
         through a computer by means of a set of formal rules, the
         use of any kind of algorithm, specific dictionaries and
         eventually knowledge representations. That means a
         literature of which the author does not write the final
         texts but which only works at the level of the high rank
         components such as: conceptual models, knowledge rules,
         dictionary entries and rhetoric definitions. A text without
         an author generally seems to be out of question. Such a
         designation seems to describe an impossible literature
         because, despite the fact we generally assume that there is
         a very strong link between a text and its author, in this
         case the author is separated from the text. In generative
         literature, there certainly also is an author but one who
         has not really written the text which is being presented to
         a reader, his function is not the one we usually assign to
         an author. The difference is: this author is something like
         a meta-author trying to define what literature is for him
         and how his literary conception can be formally described.
         The tools of engrammation he uses are totally
         different.</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#CC0000">

         <P><FONT SIZE="-1">For poetry indeed, each text is something
         like an island isolated from the other ones even when they
         are published in the same book of poetry. A poem is a text
         by itself, each poem is entirely closed and supported by
         itself. But none of these texts will ever be read by any
         other reader unless, as here, they are printed as examples
         by way of exception but generative texts usually do not
         require to be printed. And even in that case, the reception
         of generative poetry is really different from the reception
         of non-generative poetry.<BR>
         But, in this paper, I will speak about generative
         narratives, not about generative poetry, the concepts and
         approaches of which are undeniably rather different.<BR>
         Everybody knows G&eacute;rard Genette's classical definition
         of narrative (<EM>Narrative Discourse</EM>, 1972): a
         narrative is a text built on a <EM>diegetic axis</EM>, what
         he calls diegesis. That implies that any text has a
         beginning and an end. Whatever games would be played on the
         <EM>diegetic axis</EM>, it undeniably is the basic structure
         of the narrative. All the episodes of the narrative are
         organised along that structure. Such a situation is strongly
         underlined by the kind of medium which has usually been used
         to materialise the narrative: the book. A book always has a
         first page and a last one and all the reading is done by
         taking into account this constraint. We all know that. This
         does not imply that a reader cannot read back, but we also
         know that such an action is an exception from the rule and
         rather is an approach of researchers than that of an
         ordinary reader. Hence it is the <EM>diegetic axis</EM>
         which structures all the conceptions of novels or short
         stories and a reading cannot stop at any point of that axis,
         more precisely, if a reading does stop at some point it is
         to let the reader dream or think about what he has just
         read, it is like an halt during the reading process.<BR>
         The generative conception of narrative completely renovates
         such a situation. In a generative novel indeed there is an
         equivalence principle at every point of the narrative which
         is dependant on generation. At these points a text is only a
         temporary specimen of an infinite family of virtual texts.
         In concrete terms, this means that any point of the
         generative axis is the theoretical point of an infinity of
         texts and I propose to call that situation &#8220;<EM>alepsis</EM>&#8221;
         because at that point, the arrow of the <EM>diegetic
         axis</EM> is broken up for a while. In general, the
         <EM>diegesis</EM> includes all the events that allegedly
         have occurred, including actions and spaces not explicitly
         described, most of them are however offered or suggested to
         the reading in the book. In generative fiction, at the
         contrary, most of the texts will never be offered to the
         reading: most of the <EM>diegesis</EM> markers are latent
         ones. The two texts quoted above, for example, are not
         topologically situated on the <EM>diegetic axis</EM> one
         before the other but are produced for the same point of that
         axis: that signifies that they are &#8212; from a narrative
         point of view &#8212; completely equivalent: one may be read
         instead of the other. More than that there is &#8212; at
         this point &#8212; an innumerable number of virtual texts
         but, however, each of them has a function within the
         narrative process: they can be read or not (depending on the
         possibility of generation) but if they are being read, they
         offer a new view onto the narrative; if they are not being
         read, the reader does not miss them. One text can then be
         read as an alternative for all the others but it can also be
         read before or after one another. There is, on that point,
         no obligation.<BR>
         <BR>
         I am not talking of <EM>prolepsis</EM> (anticipation) or
         <EM>analepsis</EM> (back reading) which are the two main
         rhetorical tools used by a writer to build his story.
         Because <EM>prolepsis</EM> and <EM>analepsis</EM> can only
         be understood from the perspective of linear reading. There
         is neither <EM>prolepsis</EM> nor <EM>analepsis</EM> in the
         reading, the reading is linear and always backwards:
         <EM>prolepsis</EM> and <EM>analepsis</EM> are only writing
         games, engrammation procedures, playing with the arrow of
         time. In that case, the classical literary theory adopts the
         writer's point of view, not the reader's, it supposes that
         the <EM>diegetic axis</EM> can be cut in parts which can be
         easily displaced on it. Hence each story appears to be a
         combination of smaller stories which have a kind of
         independence from each other except from the
         <EM>diegesis</EM> point of view. Indeed, these fragments may
         not change in their form and once they have been given to
         the reader they are located on the arrow of time forever;
         they can not be displaced and thus the game is very
         different for the writer and for the reader: the reception
         of the text is fixed whereas this was not the case during
         its production. </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT SIZE="-1">The fact that in a generative narrative
         such a constraint was given up has introduced a great
         liberty: when a reader obtains a text, he obtains that text
         at a certain moment of his reading but he has no idea of
         what other text he could obtain at the same moment of
         another reading. He cannot tell if the text is directly
         related to the previous or the next one (in terms of reading
         time). The relation between one text and another can be a
         relation situated on the <EM>diegetic axis</EM> but it can
         also be any other kind of relation. For example, that text
         can be another concretion of the virtualities of the same
         model of text, i.e. an <EM>alepsis</EM>, a text not situated
         in a relation of time to the previous one.<BR>
         <BR>
         In that case &#8212; and this certainly is one of the
         reasons why generative texts disturb our reading habits &#8212;
         the reader loses all the usual markers relating to the
         <EM>diegetic axis</EM> and has to find or invent other kinds
         of references. The narrative is not totally built in advance
         but put together from a lot of virtualities which are &#8212;
         or are not &#8212; actualizing themselves in the course of
         reading. That reading course is then fundamental and tends
         to substitute itself to the <EM>diegetic axis</EM>. Each new
         reading &#8212; actualizing the narrative in a new way,
         built on what I call <EM>microfictions</EM> &#8212; creates
         its own <EM>diegesis</EM> which is not a predetermined but
         an undetermined <EM>diegetic axis</EM>. That really means:
         Any reader A needs to develop a unique hypothesis which
         gives him an idea of the narrative which is</FONT><BR>
         <FONT SIZE="-1">different from that of any reader B. Maybe
         he can be sure that his conception of the time in that
         narrative will be true if he can read all the virtual texts
         but that is completely impossible. The only indicators he
         can use for that are those given by each
         <EM>microfiction</EM>: each of them seems to be built on the
         basis of a local <EM>diegesis</EM> which then, for the
         reader, are necessarily related to a more general one. What
         is more important than the building of a <EM>diegetic axis
         </EM>by one author then, are the various images the reader
         always builds of a possible moving <EM>diegesis</EM>: the
         <EM>diegetic axis</EM> is totally virtual and can only be
         built by the readers&#8217; strategy which is something like
         a <EM>translepsis</EM>, an infinitely moving hypothesis of
         <EM>diegetic</EM> relations. It is what I call the <EM>&#8220;hologrammatic
         principle&#8221;</EM>: each text contains the entire time of
         all possible texts. There is no concrete <EM>diegetic
         axis</EM> but only a virtual one much more related to the
         reading than to the writing. The narrative does neither need
         beginning nor end because the narration is entirely built by
         each reading of each text: one novel can thus be constituted
         by one or an infinite number of texts and no reader reads
         the same number of it. There is no structure of the
         narrative, only an idea of a virtual one built by the
         reading itself.<BR>
         <BR>
         For the author, that situation is very interesting because
         he is free from the necessity of mainly conceiving a
         narrative in relation with time and he does not have to
         respect a linear form of engrammation. This opens up a new
         field of creativity: he has to think about and to work on
         all the virtualities implied by the generative fiction,
         time, even if by tradition it is a very important one, is
         only one of them. A narrative is not obliged to have an
         beginning and one end: Each generative narrative is made of

         the texts are quite independent apart from the fact that the

         the reader to imagine a form of <EM>diegesis</EM>. In that
         case, the design interface is a procedure
         of</FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial" COLOR="#CC0000">

         </FONT><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">It is definitely enough
         that the reader knows that he is reading a narrative because
&#8211; due to his cultural concept of narrative &#8211; he tries to
         find <EM>diegesis</EM> markers. Hence a novel can be totally
         built on an infinite present as in <EM>Fictions
         (fiction)</EM>, the reader builds a <EM>diegesis </EM>from
         its <EM>translepsis</EM> course himself. Thus generative
         literature demonstrates that the writer's control of the
         diegesis is not necessary because <EM>diegesis</EM> is a
         cognitive concept of reception: we always imagine stories on
         a time axis and even if a narrative has neither beginning
         nor end, we as readers always imagine them. Generative
         literature opens up a creative field for a renewal of
         narration. Without a doubt, the book as a product of a dated
         technology using fixed engrammation procedures has become a
         reductive matrix that we have to reform; to liberate the
         text from the linearity and the determination of its pages,
         to allow text to reveal itself by other means, in other
         contexts with other possibilities of expression. Hence
         literature is not dependent on the medium of the book any
         longer but can also use other media such as any kind of
         screens, cellular phones or computer networks. Thus there is
         no more necessity of sticking to linear forms. What
         generative literature wants to affirm today is the vital and
         infinite power of the &#8220;literary&#8221; communication
         as a dynamic diffraction of relations, where the
         always-different text manifests its identities only through
         the infinite repetitions of its generation of the same,
         through its infinite changes more than through its halts.
         What this process assumes is the fecundating power of
         language as it enriches itself within all the restraining
         particularities of any given context. It is this fecundating
         power of language upon which the receiving subject
         continually renews him- or herself.<BR>
         <BR>
         At first approach, the generative text indeed demolishes all
         the material references that are the basis of the reader's &#8220;preparation&#8221;:
         the physical appearances of the book (volume, thickness,
         division into paragraphs and chapters, and so on). Instead a
         radically new literature, putting the diegetic axis into the
         background, has to invent new forms of fiction, new forms of
         stories, new forms of narration when using other media than
         the book. A &#8220;generative novel&#8221; is thus forced to
         invent all its codes. Generative literature wants first of
         all to be something like a &#8220;literarization&#8221; of
         technology, because what it demonstrates first and foremost
         in its multiplicities and its variations, are its potentials
         and its changing states. Even if that situation is not
         absolutely new in literary history, where the eagerness to
         present texts with new technical apparatus has always
         existed, at least in the margins, the digitalization of its
         technology has created a significantly new situation for
         literature: the immediacy of its generation and its
         infinitude set on stage the formalisms from which the texts
         come forth. The relation of the subject to his or her
         writing is thus a new relation to time, and the functional
         concept of authorship itself is to be entirely redefined,
         because what matters more than anything else is the &#8220;historical&#8221;
         memory of forms and their displacement. There is no end to
         writing and reading but a generative text can infinitely be
         continued. The person who we can only call a &#8220;digital
         author&#8221; as long as there is a lack of more accurate
         terms does not need to deny tradition by means of a radical
         modernity but requires of it something like a new reading,
         or, at least, an unheard one. Generative literature's only
         pretension is to enrich the text's potentialities. It
         forsakes the fiction of fiction to be only interested in the
         subjective production and formalization of meaning. In that
         sense, it only exists through infinite literary production.
         Generative text rejects clotting, time's dictatorial
         caricature; it presents a whim of eternity. But this
         eternity-whim truly differs from that of &#8220;classical&#8221;
         literature because it does not depend on the duration of its
         memory but on the infinitude of its reproductions.<BR>
         <BR>
         Out of the book, displayed on screens or, by various
         technical processes, on any object henceforth used as a
         displaying surface, text, now able to become time and space,
         completely changes its nature. It becomes picture-text,
         sometimes even text-universe or performing-text. That old
         temptation, outlined in several historical attempts, now
         finds its fulfilment thanks to the possibilities that
         computerization allows.<BR>
         <BR>
         According to George Steiner</FONT><A HREF="Principles and Processes of Generative Literature - Balpe.htm#3"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#91;3&#93;</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A NAME=10></A>,
         the comprehension of modern art requires the acceptance of
         the fading of any conception of &#8220;culture&#8221; as
         having an immanent value, necessarily linked to hierarchical
         societies, and its replacement with a set of &#8220;cultures,&#8221;
         all regarded as equal. The computer culture, in that sense,
         is an absolutely new and absolutely up-to-date writing tool
         inventing new engrammation modalities.<BR>
         <BR>
         Generative literature does not make any claim to the
         intangible and almost-divine universality of pre-generative
         literature, in which the only active role left is in the
         production of new glosses; it merely wants to be the
         ephemeral and temporary moment of a common literarity,
         revealing itself only in the instant of the creative
         stimulus.<BR>
         More than ever before, a text is more dependent on its media
         contexts nowadays. Every surface may be used as medium for
         texts, not only sheets of paper but also all sorts of
         'screens' which can be a mountain, a building, a screen of a
         cellular phone, a person's body etc. Classical culture
         originates from a bet on transcendence: <EM>&#8220;Art and
         mind looks toward what is not yet here, at the accepted risk
         of being ignored by the living.&#8221;</EM></FONT><A HREF="Principles and Processes of Generative Literature - Balpe.htm#4"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#91;4&#93;</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A NAME=11></A>
         Classical culture is produced only for museums, for &#8220;conservation,&#8221;
         and thus is opposed to ephemeral consummation. The classical
         production of writings is aimed entirely at archives. To
         that way of thinking, the slightest &#8220;loss&#8221; is
         considered a cultural tragedy. Any destroyed manuscript is a
         burning library; the obliteration of any draft scribbled on
         a tabletop seems a disaster. Against that museum art, that
         library-and-dust art, generative writing is an art of
         consummation which refuses to look back on its tracks, which
         it regards as nothing more than signs turned toward
         something else.<BR>
         <BR>
         Real-time generative text, which exists only by its
         instantaneity, first of all fights against all this: <EM>&#8220;Everywhere
         the virus of potentiality prevails. Carrying us away toward
         a rapture which is also that of unresponsiveness.&#8221;</EM></FONT><A HREF="Principles and Processes of Generative Literature - Balpe.htm#5"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#91;5&#93;</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A NAME=12></A>
         But the unresponsiveness that Baudrillard fears is, in fact,
         a positive one because it is unresponsive to an external
         hierarchy of values, to a culture of reverence.<BR>
         <BR>
         <EM>"The public is no longer the wise echo of talent,
         something like a referee and relay in transmission of an
         atypical attempt; it associates itself to the artistic
         elaboration inside of a set of sometimes uninhibited
         energies".</EM></FONT><A HREF="Principles and Processes of Generative Literature - Balpe.htm#6"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#91;6&#93;</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A NAME=13></A><BR>
         <BR>
         The text, no longer regarded as "literary", now has to
         annihilate all reverence because a generative text can
         always be substituted by another one. Hence it is not the
         singular display which is at the heart of generative
         literature but rather the movement, the series of
         ever-changing displays of text. The computer culture is
         close to spreading, to dispersion. It introduces a new
         relation to memory, no longer &#8220;reminding&#8221; but &#8212;
         because a text, read at a given moment, is nothing other
         than an image of another text read at another moment with
         which it maintains links of dependence and independence, at
         once diffracted and refractory &#8212; rebuilding
         remembrance, active participation by the reader lies in its
         elaboration. Displaying on its screens the vanishing of the
         master, of eternity's claims, generative literature engages
         the reader as a culture in itself.<BR>
         Like all new literary approaches, generative literature must
         first struggle with that resistance within itself, to find
         the ways that are peculiar to it by rejecting, even
         sometimes at the cost of provocation and error, at the risk
         of becoming illegible, what is inside it, enclosing itself
         within the gummy thickness of its moments of arrest.<BR>
         <BR>
         While strongly individualist, the contemporary spirit is
         also gregarious, taking pleasure in the instantaneity of
         shared time, where the contemporary spirit formerly was
         collective inside the unchangeable cultural spiritual union.
         Generative literature tries to be on the side of the
         effusive superficiality of show. It wants to reconcile the
         literary activity with that of play and game: to separate
         literature from the sphere of reverential and deadly
         seriousness in which the whole classical tradition locks it.
         Not merely about a particular text, it questions itself
         infinitely about the aesthetic working of the human
         spirit.</FONT><A HREF="Principles and Processes of Generative Literature - Balpe.htm#7"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">&#91;7&#93;</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial"><A NAME=14></A></FONT></div align="justify"><A HREF="Principles and Processes of Generative Literature - Balpe.htm#7"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Arial">
