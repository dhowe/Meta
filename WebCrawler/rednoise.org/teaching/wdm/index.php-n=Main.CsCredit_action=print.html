</p><h3>An example project desc. (email) for CS concentration credit</h3>
<p>Professor,
</p>
<p class='vspace'>I would like to get 100-level credit for CS1950C (Programming for Digital Art and Literature).  I have written up a proposal below for my final project. 
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Title: My Title
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Project Overview
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Words will appear on-screen encapsulated in visuals similar to cellular organelles and/or other microscropic creatures.  Visually, these creatures will be translucent and monochromatic.  These word-creatures will be procedurally animated and will move about the screen.  The initial population will be based on a concordance of a source text of poems.  Creatures will then be able to recombine (i.e. eat eachother) to form chain-like organisms, based on a probability distribution from a word level N-gram run on the source texts.  As the user watches, words will accrete to form phrases, and ultimately sentences - and then paragraphs.  The user will be able to interact with the creatures through a "fishtank" UI metaphor, whereby the user can drop additional words into the tank by drag-and-drop from a palette of words.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Technical Implementation Overview
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The project will be implemented in Java as an applet, and the goal will be to create  a project which will run smoothly in the browser.  To this end, the project will be subject to the technical limitations placed on an applet (RAM, file system access, etc.) and thus an important aspect of the technical design will be in minimizing the memory and resource footprint of the application so that it will run as an applet.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The structure of the application will be multi-threaded and will center around a backend layer, and a frontend presentation layer - probably in separate threads.  Each word creature will be procedurally animated, and will also move based on a primarily reactive AI controller.  The AI controller will have goals such as eating targets and avoiding walls and obstacles, which will subsume eachother.  A core goal will be to create engaging and evocative visuals for the creatures, which will be based on pre-made primitives but also be paramaterized randomely at run time so as to create a wide variety of unique-looking creatures.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The goal is to simulate a large number of creatures on the backend thread and cull creatures which are not visible from the front-end rendering layer.  An N-gram will be created (probably N=3 to N=5) based on a source body of input text, probably poems which are in the public domain.  This N-gram will then be used to stochastically control whether two creatures can combine, based on the word sequence information which will be obtained from the N-gram.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Special period creatures will populate the "primordial soup" allowing sentences to form (again, based on the N-gram data) when necessary, and ultimately even paragraphs.  A UI layer will also be implemented allowing users to interact with the creatures, control the overall simulation settings, and add additional words.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Thanks,
XXYYZZ
