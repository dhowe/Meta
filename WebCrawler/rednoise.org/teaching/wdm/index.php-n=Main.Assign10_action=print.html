<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style='font-size:120%'>Assignment #10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Due Mon. April 20)</span></h3>
<p><strong>[Planning]</strong> In addition to your project description and sketches/mockups, add 2 new sections to the web page for your final project. <strong>Due by 3pm</strong> on 3/20.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><ul><li>The first should be called the 'Task List' and should list the various parts of the project that will need to be done before the project is finished. This should get you thinking about how to decompose a big project into smaller, more manageable sub-parts, which is an essential skill when doing larger pieces (in art or elsewhere). Assign each task two numbers from 1-5. The first should be called 'priority' and should represent  how essential the task it is to the success of the piece (1 means "absolutely essential", and 5 means "might be nice if there's extra time"). The second, call this 'difficulty', should represent your best guess as to how long this task will take you to complete. These two numbers, taken together, should give you a good idea of the order with which the various tasks should be done. 
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>The second should be called 'Risk Areas' and should list whatever parts of the project (taken from your task list above) that either a) would cause the project to fail if not done properly, and/or b) that you have doubts about how to do. Good examples of what should go here include any technical implementations that you are not completely sure of how to do. Equally important are any exteranl dependencies that yourproject requires Examples here include a) access to resources like dictionaries, texts, or databases, b) equipment needs, like access to a server, recording equipment for creating samples, or other hardware, eg, for a physical installation, c) any permissions required, say to install a piece in a public place, d) human resources, like participants in a performance, or help from a specialist in some part of your project (e.g graphic design), and e) exactly what you expect from any collaborators (its still not too late to join forces with a classmate). The primary goal here is identify as many possible causes of failure for your project plan as early as you can.  
</li></ul><p class='vspace'><strong>[Coding]</strong>  For this week, everyone should create a working program on that implements ONE element of your final project. This should both help to clarify your idea for others and be something you will eventually include in the finished piece. Make sure to pick some part of the project that can be addressed independently (probably something directly from your task list above.) Let me know ASAP if you are having trouble thinking about how to break things up. <strong>Add a link to the sketch</strong> on your final project page and be ready to present your sketch in class for feedback.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><strong>[Writing]</strong> This week I want to you to reflect on your experience thus far in a short writing assignment. This should be a minimum of a paragraph and a maximum of a page and specifically address the following 3 questions in the context of programming for art. 
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><ol><li>What was your most notable 'breakthrough' moment thus far; eg, when you learned some concept you'd been having a difficult time with, added a new technique to your process, or pushed a specific piece through to a new level?
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>Describe a moment (or decision) you wish could take back? Perhaps a task that now seems simple on which spent you an inordinate amount of time, some error in process (e.g., premature optimization), or some choice you made on a piece that lead you down a dead-end.    
<div class='vspace'></div></li><li>What's the most important thing that feel you have NOT quite learned yet. This could be a specific technical concept, some part of the 'making' process on which you feel stuck or frustrated, or something you find lacking in one or more of your works.
</li></ol><div class='vspace'></div><div class='indent'><strong>Send this to me via email</strong> before class on 3/20.
